> JSON Response Example

```go
{
  "primaryseed":        "hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello",
  "addressesremaining": 2500,
  "allseeds":           [
    "hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello",
    "foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo bar foo",
  ]
}
```
**primaryseed**  
Seed that is actively being used to generate new addresses for the wallet.

**addressesremaining**  
Number of addresses that remain in the primary seed until exhaustion has been
reached. Once exhaustion has been reached, new addresses will continue to be
generated but they will be more difficult to recover in the event of a lost
wallet file or encryption password.

**allseeds**  
Array of all seeds that the wallet references when scanning the blockchain for
outputs. The wallet is able to spend any output generated by any of the seeds,
however only the primary seed is being used to generate new addresses.
